      <p>We were in this small cafe on our morning </p> 
         <p>tea break</p>tea break
      <p>Me and some of my work colleagues</p>
      <p>Someone inquired after my wellbeing</p>
      <p><i>How I was</i></p>
      <p>I motioned with my hand as if to say 'So, so"</p>
      <p>Then I said</p>
      <p>"I'm still a bit shaky"</p>
      <p>'Why", they said, "what happened to you ?"</p>
     <p>I answered "I was in a car crash last night"</p> 
      <p>"What!!!", they all said really concerned, "you shouldn't have come to work today, you should have stayed at home... you might be in </p>
       <p> shock!"</p>
      <p>Then I said 'It was only a dream'. I went on "Yea, I dreamt I was in a car </p>

     <p>It was like a spiral staircase, going round and </p> 
         <p>round</p>
      <p>All these terrible bends</p>
      <p>And the car it's getting faster and I know I'm </p>
        <p>starting to lose control</p>
