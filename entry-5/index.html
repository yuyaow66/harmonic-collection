    <h1>Poem of the Day</h1>
    <p> 
      <p>In through the Out door</p>
      <p>We were in this small cafe on our morning </p> 
         <p>tea break</p>tea break
      <p>Me and some of my work colleagues</p>
      <p>Someone inquired after my wellbeing</p>
      <p><i>How I was</i></p>
      I motioned with my hand as if to say 'So, so"
      Then I said
      "I'm still a bit shaky"
      'Why", they said, "what happened to you ?"
      I answered "I was in a car crash last night"
      "What!!!", they all said really concerned, "you shouldn't have come to work today, you should have stayed at home... you might be in 
        shock!"
      Then I said 'It was only a dream'. I went on "Yea, I dreamt I was in a car 
        crash
      I was driving down this terrible winding 
         mountain road 
      Like something you'd get over in Italy 
      It was like a spiral staircase, going round and 
         round
      All these terrible bends
      And the car it's getting faster and I know I'm 
         starting to lose control
      So for a moment I look down trying to figure 
         out the controls
      But suddenly when I look up again we've 
         overshot a Bend 
      And We're heading straight into a wall
      It's like everything goes into slow motion
      You know there's no avoiding it
      You can only brace yourself for the impact
      And then BAM!! POW**!!! .....
      And then I can't remember what happened 
         after that.
      Maybe I became unconscious"....then looking 
         at them all around the table I said
      "Maybe I'm still unconscious, maybe I'm just dreaming you guys sitting here 
         right now
      Maybe the dreamworld is the real world
      And the real world but a dream...(tapping my finger on the table) a solid dream"
      Then I took a sip of my coffee and said
      "One thing...the coffee tastes nicer over on 
        this side".
